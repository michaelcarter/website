June 2021</h1><p class="header__subtitle">Revenue and reflections on my third month of working as a freelance development consultant.</p></div></div></header><main class="article__content wrapper-article"><p>Working hours were a problem for me in April and May, but I managed to keep time under control in June with a few polite-but-firm refusals. The result was a month mainly focussed on work, with some wavering progress on the content and product front, but a renewed feeling of control.</p><h2>The stats</h2><div class="table__container"><table class="table"><tr><th>Month</th><th>Site views</th><th>Post views</th><th>Twitter profile views</th><th>Enquiries</th><th>Days off</th><th>Revenue</th></tr><tr><th>April 2021</th><td>1,137</td><td>749</td><td>4,800</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>£7,800</td></tr><tr><th>May 2021</th><td>1,263</td><td>3,144</td><td>4,660</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>£4,200</td></tr><tr><th>June 2021</th><td>1,192</td><td>549</td><td>6,620</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>£6,700</td></tr></table></div><h3>Revenue</h3><p>I issued invoices for <strong>£6,700</strong> (~$9,200) excluding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VAT</a> in June. These came from a mixture of consulting and development work for two different clients. As with previous months, this covers my household expenses and savings goals just fine, so no problems there.</p><p>As in May, June&#39;s revenue figure represents only the work I billed on an hourly basis. A lot of the other work I did in June is being billed on fixed-cost basis, meaning I won&#39;t be able to invoice for it until it&#39;s finished later in July or early August.</p><h3>Enquiries</h3><p>I received <strong>1 new work enquiry</strong> in June. It was from a London-based company looking for some help developing new software for a commercial IoT (Internet of Things) device. It seemed like it would be an interesting project, but unfortunately I had to turn it down due to a lack of availability.</p><h3>Website visits</h3><p>My site homepage received <strong>1,192 page views</strong> in June. Like last month, there&#39;s been no significant change here. I&#39;m fine with this, as building any sort of traffic there is going to be a really slow burner, and it&#39;s currently just a brochure site for prospective clients.</p><h3>Posts visits</h3><p>My blog posts received a combined total of <strong>549 views</strong> in June, which is rather poor. Although some of those views came from traffic to older posts, which is always a good sign that people are actually reading things, the two posts I wrote in June flunked a bit.</p><p>My most recent post, <a href="https://mcarter.me/posts/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-an-app">"How much does it cost to make an app?"</a> answers a commonly googled (and asked) question. It&#39;s really targeted at prospective clients, but so far has only been shared with co-workers and Twitter followers, and so hasn&#39;t been read much. I&#39;m going to see if I can change this by sharing it on LinkedIn, and perhaps some Q&A sites where it might find a more receptive audience in July.</p><p>Earlier in June, I completely screwed up by sharing <a href="https://mcarter.me/posts/update-may-2021">May&#39;s freelancing update</a> right before Apple&#39;s Worldwide Developer Conference kicked off:</p><img class="article-image article-image--bordered" src="/assets/images/posts/update-june-2021/update-tweet.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing a Tweet about my May freelancing update. The Tweet reads 'Don't care about #WWDC? Luckily for you, my next freelancing update is out!'."><p>It turns out perhaps people <em>do</em> care about the WWDC. That Tweet got missed almost entirely, and just 13 people looked at that post in the entire month. Oops!</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Twitter stats were up across the board in June, although I gained just 5 new followers this month:</p><img class="article-image article-image--bordered" src="/assets/images/posts/update-june-2021/twitter-stats.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my Twitter analytics for June 2021. It shows 81 tweets, 75,400 tweet impressions, 6,620 profile visits, 63 mentions, and 391 followers (5 more than last month)."><p>If I&#39;m honest, trying to figure out what strikes a chord with anyone on Twitter is one of the least favourite parts of my work right now. I&#39;m struggling to find valuable things to share because a lot of the work I do just isn&#39;t particularly visual or interesting. I&#39;ll keep on trying though, as Twitter could be very valuable for me if I can figure it out.</p><h2>Choosing a product idea</h2><p>One of the goals I set for myself for June was to choose a product idea to build. After much deliberation, I&#39;ve settled on something I think could succeed commercially, and which I could reasonably develop, launch, and maintain by myself.</p><p>The product would allow people to sell online events or content in an auction-style setup, with customers bidding for access. Targeted at those with a high demand for their time and knowledge, the platform would essentially give them an easy way to generate revenue by simply sharing a link with their audience and waiting for bids to roll in.</p><p>For example, if I were a well known expert on a particular technology and I wanted to run a video workshop, I could quickly configure a link with 10 seats for auction on it and tweet a link to my followers. They could then bid on access to the event, with the top 10 highest bids being invited to participate.</p><p>The use cases I envisage this working for are various permutations of <strong>[in-demand person]</strong> selling access to <strong>[scarce resource]</strong> online. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>A tech influencer</strong> selling <strong>10 seats to a video workshop</strong> on some new framework.</li><li><strong>A famous band</strong> selling <strong>a series of one-on-one Q&As</strong> with the band members.</li><li><strong>A well known game developer</strong> selling <strong>50 early-access invites</strong> to their title.</li><li><strong>A highly sought-after consultant</strong> selling <strong>a spare half-day</strong> of their expertise.</li></ul><p>I&#39;ve no idea if this is a good idea or not yet, so my next steps are to hone the pitch, and then make contact with some potential sellers on the service. I&#39;m going to ask them directly if they&#39;d use it if I were to build it, and if this goes well, I&#39;ll begin planning in earnest.</p><h2>Reflections and goals for July</h2><p>Overall I was pleased with how June went, but everything was <em>ok</em> without anything being <em>great</em>. I&#39;d like to have a win on the content creation or audience building front sooner or later, as this takes up a huge amount of time and energy. To get there though, I may just need to keep experimenting and see what works for a little while longer.</p><p>I have a busy July ahead of me with a few days booked off for various activities now that Covid restrictions are loosening in the UK, so I&#39;m keeping my goals fairly simple to ensure I'm able to maintain the control over my time that I&#39;ve been fighting for these past few months:</p><ol><li>Get 10 responses to a &#8220;Would you use this?&#8221; question from well known tech influencers who sell educational content online.</li><li>Write another blog post focused on product engineering.</li><li>Outsource or stop doing 3 low value, time consuming activities.</li><li>Finish my fixed-cost development project and invoice for it.</li></ol><p>That&#39;s all for June!
