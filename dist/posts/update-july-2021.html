July 2021</h1><p class="header__subtitle">Revenue and reflections on my fourth month of working as a freelance development consultant.</p></div></div></header><main class="article__content wrapper-article"><p>July was difficult. I failed several of my goals, changed my mind on the product I want to build, and neglected my social media activity. July was also my most profitable month to date, invoicing almost double my average revenue for April, May and June.</p><h2>Stats for July</h2><div class="table__container"><table class="table"><tr><th>Month</th><th>Site views</th><th>Post views</th><th>Twitter profile views</th><th>Enquiries</th><th>Days off</th><th>Revenue</th></tr><tr><th>April 2021</th><td>1,137</td><td>749</td><td>4,800</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>£7,800</td></tr><tr><th>May 2021</th><td>1,263</td><td>3,144</td><td>4,660</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>£4,200</td></tr><tr><th>June 2021</th><td>1,192</td><td>549</td><td>6,620</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>£6,700</td></tr><tr><th>July 2021</th><td>1,160</td><td>596</td><td>3,330</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>£11,800</td></tr></table></div><h3>Revenue</h3><p>I issued invoices for <strong>£11,800</strong> (~$15,575) excluding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VAT</a> in July. These came from a mixture of consulting and development work for two different clients. My revenue was so much higher in July because I was finally able to invoice for a long-running piece of fixed cost work I&#39;d been doing part-time since April. This single invoice accounted for about 50% of the total revenue for July.</p><h3>Enquiries</h3><p>I received <strong>1 new work enquiry</strong> in July from a semi-local company looking for some straight-forward React development help. I had to turn them down due to lack of availability, but it&#39;s important I keep these enquiries coming in as knowing the opportunity is there gives me the confidence to say no to things I don&#39;t want to do, and a peace of mind that&#39;s hard to come by for the self-employed!</p><h3>Marketing</h3><p>One of my goals for July was to write a blog post focussed on product engineering. I&#39;m disappointed to say I failed to make the time to write anything, and so unsurprisingly my site and blog posts received about the same number of views as they did in previous months - <strong>1,160 views</strong> for the website, and <strong>596</strong> for blog posts.</p><p>I also neglected my social media activity in July. On Twitter, my tweets, impressions, profile visits and mentions were all between 50-80% lower than June - eek!</p><img class="article-image article-image--bordered" src="/assets/images/posts/update-july-2021/twitter-stats.jpg" alt="A screenshot of my Twitter analytics for July 2021. It shows 41 tweets, 17,500 tweet impressions, 3,329 profile visits, 12 mentions, and 392 followers (3 more than last month)."><h2>Building a different product</h2><p>In June&#39;s update I wrote an entire section on a product idea I wanted to pursue. The product was going to allow people to sell online events or content in an auction-style setup, with customers bidding for access.</p><p>After reflecting on this, I&#39;ve changed my mind, and am instead going to look at building a small indie analytics platform that helps writers monitor and build an audience by providing some deep insight into who&#39;s reading their posts. This was my runner-up idea in June, but I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s actually the best option for me personally:</p><ul><li>Analytics is a proven market.</li><li>The idea excites me more.</li><li>The idea is easier to explain.</li><li>It&#39;s a product I would use myself.</li><li>It&#39;s more visual, and so easier to share progress on.</li></ul><p>I intend to break ground on this in August, defining a tight scope for a first launch, and making some technology choices.</p><h2>Flirting with burnout</h2><p>I felt a little like I was flirting with burnout for much of July. Trying to wrap up old projects, continue ongoing work, move forward a product idea, write blog posts, and think of insightful things to Tweet about all got a little much at times.</p><p>Rather than trying to keep up with it all, I made the sensible call and let my writing and Twitter activity slide in order to keep working hours normal. Although this is probably good for me, it often doesn&#39;t <em>feel</em> good. I&#39;m someone who gets job satisfaction from completing tasks, so accepting I won&#39;t finish something I set out to achieve can often be stressful in itself.</p><h2>Goals for August</h2><p>With that in mind, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m only going to set goals each month that contribute towards my long term objectives of building an audience for my consulting work, and growing a successful digital product. This way, I can put something off for a month without it being perceived as a failure, because the goals will always be relevant. Here are my goals for August:</p><ol><li>Write a blog post focused on product engineering.</li><li>Scope out a first release and make technology choices for my analytics product.</li></ol><p>That&#39;s all for July!
