Here are the numbers and reflections on my second month.</p></div></header><main><p>Time was a major theme in May. Between handling client work, content production, legal to-dos, and various other admin tasks, it&#39;s becoming clear that successful freelancing is going to need me to be deliberate (and a bit ruthless) about where I give my time.</p><p>I mentioned in April&#39;s update that I was working more than full time hours in order to keep up with everything. That was still the case in May, but I was able to spot a few low value requests early, and either delegate or refuse them. Progress!</p><p>Despite working more hours than I&#39;d like, May was still enjoyable. Getting comfortable with the idea that I&#39;m no longer tied to a 9-5 schedule has lead to some nice spontaneous dog walks, early starts, late starts, and outdoor lunches. I even took a week off!</p><h2>The stats</h2><table class="table"><tr><th>Month</th><th>Site views</th><th>Post views</th><th>Twitter profile views</th><th>Enquiries</th><th>Days off</th><th>Revenue</th></tr><tr><th>April 2021</th><td>1,137</td><td>749</td><td>4,800</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>£7,800</td></tr><tr><th>May 2021</th><td>1,263</td><td>3,144</td><td>4,660</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>£4,200</td></tr></table><h3>Revenue</h3><p>I issued invoices for <strong>£4,200</strong> (~$5,950) excluding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VAT</a> in May. These came from a mixture of consulting and development work for three different clients. If you read the <a href="/posts/update-april-2021">April update</a>, you&#39;ll probably have noticed this is a £3,600 drop from last month. There are a couple of reasons for this:</p><ol><li><strong>Time off:</strong> I took a week off in May, and when your income relies on you being at your computer, weeks off are <em>expensive</em>. I only took 5 days, but the time lost travelling, catching up on emails, and other small non-billable tasks in addition to those days really put a dent in my billable hours.</li><li><strong>Fixed cost work:</strong> One of the projects I&#39;m working on is priced on a fixed-cost basis. I put many hours into it in May, but I won&#39;t be paid for it until later this year. My other work is invoiced on an hourly basis, and so I invoice whatever time I&#39;ve spent on it at the end of each month. It&#39;s this that you see invoiced for May above.</li></ol><p>Despite the lower number, I&#39;m happy with revenue for May. It&#39;s enough to cover my saving and investment goals, and the drop was entirely expected and normal.</p><h3>Enquiries</h3><p>I received <strong>1 new work enquiry</strong> in May. It was a respectable lead, and one that I was incredibly well positioned to help. However, there was a direct conflict of interest with my largest client, and so I turned them down gently in order to avoid a situation I&#39;d feel morally uneasy about.</p><p>The consulting enquiry that I previously mentioned I was keen to move forward with in April&#39;s update seems to have lost its momentum in May. Knowing the company, I suspect this is them just being busy with other things rather than changing their mind, so I&#39;m going to reach back out to them in June to see if they&#39;re ready to move forwards.</p><h3>Website visits</h3><p>My site homepage received <strong>1263 page views</strong> in May. This is a few more eyeballs than last month, but nothing significant. I expect driving this number up in a significant way will take months and years of effort.</p><h3>Posts visits</h3><p>My blog posts received a combined total of <strong>3144 views</strong> in May. This is a huge 2.8x improvement on my April numbers, and largely comes down to some lucky retweets:</p><img class="article-image article-image--bordered" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/blog-post-tweet.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a Tweet I wrote about a blog blog post on this website, showing 13 retweets, 1 quote tweet, and 20 likes."><p>I&#39;m obviously pleased with this, but it&#39;s important for me to remember these people aren&#39;t <em>my</em> readers. I need to keep my head down and keep producing valuable things to build an audience of my own.</p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>I managed to tweet every working day in May. It continues to feel like hard work, but I did manage to gain <strong>26 new followers</strong> this month, so maybe that&#39;s progress:</p><img class="article-image article-image--bordered" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/twitter-stats.png" alt="A screenshot of my Twitter analytics for May 2021. It shows 66 tweets, 45,600 tweet impressions, 4,660 profile visits, 55 mentions, and 385 followers (26 more than last month)."><p>My new followers seem to have come early in the month as a result of some well received Tweets, plus a some chance retweets from 2020. Apart from the new followers though, my stats are down across the board for May due to the week off.</p><p>All things considered, I&#39;m pleased with my Twitter progress for May, I&#39;ll keep at it throughout June and see where I end up!</p><h2>Goals from last month</h2><p>I set myself 5 goals for May based on my reflections from April. I&#39;m pleased to say that I managed to complete all 5:</p><ol><li>Take a week off.</li><li>Write a blog post focused on product engineering.</li><li>Tweet every working day, trying to be insightful.</li><li>Generating 3 product ideas that I think could work, and analyse the viability of each.</li><li>Generate enough revenue to cover living expenses and investment goals again.</li></ol><p>There&#39;s no need to go into detail on most of these, but I thought you might be interested in my week off and product ideas.</p><h3>Taking a week off</h3><p>After living indoors since November, we spent a week in Cornwall eating pasties, drinking cider, and doing big clifftop walks. It was <em>beautiful</em>:</p><div class="gallery"><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-1-thumb.jpg" alt="The woods were in bloom."></a><figcaption class="gallery__caption">The woods were in bloom.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-2-thumb.jpg" alt="There were some stunning houses."></a><figcaption class="gallery__caption">There were some stunning houses.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-3-thumb.jpg" alt="A coastal path atop cliffs near St. Ives."></a><figcaption class="gallery__caption">A coastal path atop cliffs near St. Ives.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-4-thumb.jpg" alt="A lighthouse and cliffs near St. Ives."></a><figcaption class="gallery__caption">A lighthouse and cliffs near St. Ives.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-5-thumb.jpg" alt="Bramley monitoring the situation in Fowey harbour."></a><figcaption class="gallery__caption">Bramley monitoring the situation in Fowey harbour.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a class="gallery__image-link" href="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="gallery__image" src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/trip-6-thumb.jpg" alt="Things got a bit treacherous here.

It always takes me a few days to get out of work mode, but once I do, I can really begin to decompress. Within days, my brain begins to make sense of things that have been bothering me, and the way forward becomes much clearer on various fronts.</p><h3>Generating 3 viable product ideas</h3><p>I really struggled with this goal. Ideas come to me easily, but I usually convince myself they&#39;re not worth pursuing for one reason or another. To ovecome this, I introduced some constraints to act as a filter for ideas that could work well for someone like me - a technical solo founder looking to build an additional revenue stream:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple but growable:</strong> The product needs to be simple enough that I can launch and develop it on my own, but have some trajectory for growth.</li><li><strong>Clear value:</strong> The product&#39;s value needs to be clear to see so it can be effectively marketed.</li><li><strong>Low support needs:</strong> The product needs to have low support needs, or support that I could easily outsource.</li><li><strong>In a proven market:</strong> Finding product-market fit is hard, better to build a fresh take on an existing product which has done that work already.</li><li><strong>That I will use:</strong> I&#39;d like to solve a problem that I have myself so I can spot bugs, issues, and opportunities in the product.</li></ul><p>With those constraints in mind, here are the 3 front-runners from a series of ideas I had this month:</p><ul><li><strong>A simple, private analytics platform for long-form content.</strong> This would allow content marketers and bloggers to see how much people are actually reading their content, and where readers drop off, skip sections, etc.</li><li><strong>A blogging platform that allows you to own your content.</strong> Too many popular blogging platforms don&#39;t allow users to truly own their content. I&#39;d like to see a compelling product solve that, and a few other common blogging platform issues.</li><li><strong>A product that lets people to put together online events that can be bid upon.</strong> For example, to let a consultant sell an hour of their time to the highest bidder, or let an tech influencer run a workshop for the 10 highest bidders.</li></ul><p>I&#39;ve not made a decision on any of these yet, I&#39;m going to do more thinking and investigation over June with a view to comitting to giving one a try.</p><h2>Goals for June</h2><p>I&#39;m feeling fairly refreshed and motivated at the moment, but have a busy couple of months ahead with client work. With that in mind, I&#39;ve given myself just 4 goals for June:</p><ol><li>Write another blog post focused on product engineering.</li><li>Tweet every working day, trying to be insightful.</li><li>Choose a product idea to build.</li><li>Outsource or stop doing 3 low value, time consuming activities.</li></ol><p>That&#39;s all for May!
