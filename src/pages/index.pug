            h3 Experience and expertise

            p.lead Software developers aren’t hard to find, but seasoned experts are.

            p With 17 years experience, I’ve focused my career on developing robust, scaleable web applications that deliver real value for businesses in multiple sectors, and on multiple continents.

            h3 Communication and leadership

            p.lead Strong communication and strategic thinking skills are a workplace superpower.

            p I use clear written, verbal and visual communication to achieve a shared understanding between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

            h3 Removing risk and uncertainty
            p.lead Done poorly, developing digital products can be expensive, slow, and offer little return on investment.

            p I derisk digital product development by keeping solutions simple, scaleable, and complimentary to your development team’s current skillsets.

            h3 Delivering results
            p.lead Getting decisions made and work completed in a dynamic business environment can be tough.

            p I work efficiently by understanding the needs of different stakeholders, systematically eliminating concerns, and making it easy for people to say “yes”.

          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What languages do you work with?
            p I primarily work with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> and their popular frameworks (React, Express, Rails, etc). Naturally my <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> are strong too.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Can  you charge a fixed price?
            p Yes. I prefer to charge a fixed price for projects, because my clients prefer price certainty. I invoice on a 50% up-front, 50% prior to go-live basis.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What’s your day rate?
            p Where a fixed cost is not practical or desired, I charge a rate of <strong>£800 per day</strong>. At the end of each month I’ll issue an invoice for days worked.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Do you offer ongoing support?
            p My work comes with <strong>30 days</strong> of complimentary bug fixes and support from the point it goes live. Outside of this, support can be negotiated on a per-engagement basis.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Will you work with our developers?
            p Yes, I love to work with other developers. Collaboration is great for quality software, it allows me to share best practices your business can benefit from after I’m gone.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What if our plans change?
            p In the event of a change of plans, we can negotiate something new or cancel the project completely. Cancellations will mean no deliverables from me, and no 50% final payment for you.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Will you come to our offices?
            p Yes. I primarily work remotely, but I’m happy to be with you in-person when it makes sense to do so. This can be factored into the scope of your project, or billed for at my hourly rate.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What if we need more people?
            p I have a wide network of skilled developers, designers, and project managers I’ve worked with previously. If necessary, I can pull in the right people to keep things running smoothly.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Do you have availability?
            p I’m currently booked until <strong>May 2023</strong>. I’m often booked out several months ahead, so if you’re planning something, contact me early to avoid disappointment.
