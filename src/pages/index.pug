          h3 BitBrawn <span class="card__dates">2021 - Present</span>
          p I founded BitBrawn, which builds and modernises the software that scaling SMEs rely on when off the shelf tools and spreadsheets can no longer keep up. We design, develop, and support custom web applications that remove operational friction, eliminate rigid workflows, and create the clarity teams need to grow with confidence. Every project is delivered by senior specialists and structured around fixed price milestones so outcomes stay predictable. <a href="https://bitbrawn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit BitBrawn</a>.

          p Recent work includes:

          h3 Leaf <span class="card__dates">2016 - 2021</span>

          p Highlights:

          ul

          p I’m the technical co-founder on IsThereSomebody, a private, anonymous app that connects people who are supporting someone through addiction. It matches you with others in similar situations and lets you talk one-to-one through encrypted chat, share experiences in a small community space, and access curated resources when you need more structured help.

          h3 Parable <span class="card__dates">2022 - 2023</span>
          p Parable is an analytics platform for blog posts and articles. It tracks how many people actually read your content, and provides analytics useful to writers trying to grow an audience.
          p I built Parable in my free time over the course of a year, and launched it in 2022. It was a fun project to build, and I learned a lot about product development and marketing.
          p Unfortunately, Parable didn’t find product-market fit and I <a href="/posts/my-first-failed-product">shut it down in 2023</a>.

          h3 Howdy <span class="card__dates">2017 - 2022</span>
          p Howdy was a simple tool that identifies contact forms on web pages and brings them to life, validating input and emailing submissions to the form owner.
          p Designed for the small businesses who just want a functional contact form. Howdy offered a cheap but effective solution to the problem of setting up contact forms. We developed it at Leaf in our spare time, and watched it organically grow to over 100 users before its eventual winding down in 2022.
