        h2 Frequently asked questions
        .content-grid.content-grid--3col.content-grid--highlight
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What languages do you work with?
            p I primarily work with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong> and their popular frameworks (React, Express, Rails, etc). Naturally my <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> are strong too.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Can  you charge a fixed price?
            p Yes. I prefer to charge a fixed price for projects, because my clients prefer price certainty. I invoice on a 50% up-front, 50% prior to go-live basis. 
          .content-grid__item 
            h3.small What’s your day rate?
            p Where a fixed cost is not practical or desired, I charge a rate of <strong>£800 per day</strong>. At the end of each month I’ll issue an invoice for days worked.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Do you offer ongoing support?
            p My work comes with <strong>30 days</strong> of complimentary bug fixes and support from the point it goes live. Outside of this, support can be negotiated on a per-engagement basis.
          .content-grid__item 
            h3.small Will you work with our developers?
            p Yes, I love to work with other developers. Collaboration is great for quality software, allows it allows me to share best practices your business can benefit from after I’m gone.
          .content-grid__item 
            h3.small What if our plans change?
            p In the event of a change of plans, we can negotiate something new or cancel the project completely. Cancellations will mean no deliverables from me, and no 50% final payment for you.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Will you come to our offices?
            p Yes. I primarily work remotely, but I’m happy to be with you in-person when it makes sense to do so. This can be factored into the scope of your project, or billed for at my hourly rate.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small What if we need more people?
            p I have a wide network of skilled developers, designers, and project managers I’ve worked with previously. If necessary, I can pull in the right people to keep things running smoothly.
          .content-grid__item
            h3.small Do you have availability?
            p I’m currently booked until <strong>the end of 2022</strong>. I’m often booked out several months ahead, so if you’re planning something, contact me early to avoid disappointment.

            p.lead It’s all too common for software development projects to go off the rails, costing time, money and opportunity with an inexperienced development partner.
            p I’ve built products for businesses of many different sizes and in many different sectors over the past decade. I know my onions, but I also know when there’s value in defering to subject matter experts for a second opinion or additional development support.
