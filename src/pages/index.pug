            p.lead Traditionally, developing a digital product is an expensive, time consuming endeavour that frequently offers little return on investment. What’s more, professional software development is completely unregulated, making choosing a competent development partner a risky proposition.

            p My goal is to de-risk your digital product development journey. I combine true technical expertise, extensive industry experience, and excellent communication skills to bring your product to market in the form of a quality, scaleable piece of software that generates real value for your business.

            p.lead It can be hard to move quickly in a business environment. There are tradeoffs to be made, stakeholders to win over, value to prove, priorities that change, and blockers to avoid.

            p I’ve spent the past decade working to become adept at delivering software in these conditions. I’ll work closely with the relevant stakeholders in your business to make sure there’s a clear shared vision for your product aligned with your strategic objectives.

            p.lead It’s all too common for software development projects to go off the rails. Typically losing time, money and opportunity with with an inexperienced development partner.

            p I’ve built products for businesses of many different sizes and in many different sectors over the past decade. I know my onions, but I also know when there's value in defering to subject matter experts for a second opinion or additional development support.
