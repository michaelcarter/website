      h2 Revenue
      p In my second month of freelancing, I issued invoices for <strong>£4,200</strong> (~$5,950) excluding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VAT</a>. This has come from a mixture of consulting and development work for <strong>three different clients</strong>. If you read last month's update, you'll know it's a considerable drop from my first month, in which I invoiced £3,600 more. There are a couple of reasons for this:

      ol
        li <strong>Time off:</strong> I took a much needed week off in May, and when your income relies on you being at your computer, weeks off are <em>expensive</em>. This is why I'm so keen to eventually develop a digital product of my own - it allows me to break the relationship between time at my desk, and income generated.
        li <strong>Fixed cost work:</strong> One of the projects I'm working on is a long-running development project priced on a fixed-cost basis. I've been working on it this month, but I won't be paid for it until probably August. My other work is invoiced on an hourly basis, and so I invoice whatever time I've spent on it at the end of each month, which is what you see invoiced for May.

      p Despite the drop, I'm happy with the second month's revenue. It's enough to cover my saving and investment goals, the time off was priceless (more on that in a bit), and the money I'm not getting for my fixed cost work now I <em>will</em> be getting later in the summer.

      h2 Enquiries
      p I received <strong>1 new work enquiry</strong> in May. It was a decent lead, that I was incredibly well positioned to help, but there was a direct conflict of interest with an existing client, and so I turned them down gently in order to avoid a sticky situation.

      p The consulting enquiry that I mentioned I was keen to move forward with in April's update seems to have lost its momentum in May and so nothing has happened there yet. Knowing the company, I suspect this is them just being busy with other things rather than changing their mind, so I'm going to reach back out to them in June to see if they're ready to move forwards.

      h2 Audience building

      h3 Website
      p My site homepage received <strong>1263 page views</strong> in May. This is a few more eyeballs than last month, but nothing I'd deem significant. I expect driving this number up in a significant way will take many months and years of effort.

      h3 Blog posts
      p My blog posts received a combined total of <strong>3144 views</strong> in May. This is a huge 2.8x improvement on my April numbers, and largely comes down to a chance retweet (and subsequently more retweets) by someone with a large following on Twitter:

      img.article-image.article-image--bordered(src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/blog-post-tweet.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a Tweet I wrote about a blog blog post on this website, showing 13 retweets, 1 quote tweet, and 20 likes.")

      p I'm obviously pleased with this, but it's important for me to remember these people aren't <em>my</em> readers. I need to keep my head down and keep writing, and promoting to build a viewership of my own.

      h3 Twitter
      p I managed to keep up my Twitter spree in May and tweeted every working day. It continues to feel like hard work, but I had some more success on the follower front this month, gaining <strong>26 new followers</strong>:


      img.article-image.article-image--bordered(src="/assets/images/posts/update-may-2021/twitter-stats.png" alt="A screenshot of my Twitter analytics for April 2021. It shows 66 tweets, 45,600 tweet impressions, 4,660 profile visits, 55 mentions, and 385 followers (26 more than last month).")

      p These new followers came early in the month as a result of some chance retweets some old (2020) content I'd produced plus a few well received Tweets early in the month. Apart from the new followers, my stats are down across the board for May due to that pesky week off.

      p I'm pleased with my Twitter progress for May, I'll keep at it throughout June and see where I end up!

      h2 Reflections and Goals

      p At the end of April I set myself 5 goals for May:

      ol
        li Take a week off.
        li Write a blog post focused on product engineering.
        li Tweet every working day, trying to be insightful.
        li Put together 3 product ideas that I think could work, and analyse viability of each.
        li Generate enough revenue to cover living expenses and investment goals again.

      p I'm pleased to say that with the exception of analysing the viability of some of my product ideas, I managed to complete all 5.

      h2 Reflections
      p I took on too much in my first month of freelancing. I was able to keep all of my <em>client</em> work inside a 40 hour work week, but as anyone who&#39;s worked for themselves knows, there&#39;s much more other work to be done too. Admin, finances, marketing, sales and content creation all take significant time, and these ended up running into evenings and weekends in April. I need to make sure these tasks are being completed within work hours rather than being squeezed around already full days.

      p One of my goals for this year is to release a digital product of my own too. Besides dismissing a few half-baked ideas, I didn&#39;t make any progress on this in April. I need to take concrete steps towards making a digital product a reality in May.

      p I also realised in April that I need some time off. The UK has been in some sort of lockdown throughout 2021 so far, and as a result there&#39;s not been much to do other than work since November last year. This has left me feeling tired, easily distracted, and uninterested in things. Now that the lockdown is easing slightly, and the weather is better, I think it&#39;s probably a good time for me to get away from my computer for a week and do something different.

      h2 Goals
      p I have 5 goals for May. All but the last item in this list are things I have direct control over, and so this should be achieveable:

      ol
        li Take a week off.
        li Write a blog post focused on product engineering.
        li Tweet every working day, trying to be insightful.
        li Put together 3 product ideas that I think could work, and analyse viability of each.
        li Generate enough revenue to cover living expenses and investment goals again.

      p That&#39;s all for April!
