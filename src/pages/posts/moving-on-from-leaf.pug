        p In 2015, <a href="http://chrisannetts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Annetts</a> and I set up <a href="Leaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leaf</a>, a small remote digitial agency, while we were still employed at our previous jobs. We went full time with Leaf mid 2016, and have enjoyed a great deal of success over the last 5 years thanks to a combination of amazing clients, a smart and hard-working team, and loyal friends within the industry. However, a short while ago I approached Chris about wanting to wind the company down and my desires to pursue a solo development career.

        h2 Why I'm going solo
        p I did a lot of introspection after the new year, and decided I'd like to change my work in three big ways that weren't compatible with running an agency full time.

        h3 Control over my time
        p I realised recently that my 20s were a bit of a blur. Much of that time was spent working hard to do standard grown-up things like buy a house, get experience in your chosen career, and save/invest any spare money I had for the future. I'm now 32, and while I love my work, I want to be more careful with how I spend my time. Going solo will give me more flexibility to take time off, and work at times I can be productive rather than within the constaints of a 9-5 job, and a 40 hour work week.

        h3 Trying new things
        p Throughout my career to date I've always found it difficult to get time to experiment with new technologies, ideas, and directions despite having a strong desire to do so. Commitments to organisations and employees have rightfully always come first. Going solo allows me to make quick decisions around my work and take bigger risks knowing I'm not going to impact negatively on others in the process.

        h3 Playing to my strengths
        p I like to work closely with people on code and product problems, and I'm naturally suited to long periods of singularly-focused effort. I'm good at this style of work, and it's always made me happy, so it seems wrong not to work in this way as much as I can. Unfortunately, running an agency demands a lot of shallow work time that just doesn't gel with my particular brain chemistry.

        h2 What I'll be doing next

        h3 Consulting
        p From April 2021 I'll be working as a freelance development consultant with a focus on helping organisations get digital products to market with solid foundations, room to scale, and costs under control. I love all the new technologies available on the web today, but I believe we've over-complicated web application development to an absurd degree as an industry. I'd like to work against that trend by helping organisations get their digital products off to the best start.

        h3 Product development
        p Alongside my freelancing, I'll be taking time each week to begin building my own digital product. This will dovetail nicely in with my client work, showing I practice what I preach, but hopefully will also help contribute towards a growing "portfolio of small bets" (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo" target="_blank", rel="noopener">Daniel Vassallo</a>!) that comprise my overall income. For now this portfolio is just Leaf and investment income, but by the end of the year I'm aiming to have grown that to income from consulting, investments, property rental and digital product revenue.

        h3 Writing
        p Lastly, I'm going to be blogging about my journey as a solo developer. I'll keep things open by sharing details on the financials of the endeavour as I go, as well as other juicy insights as I build in public.

        p If you'd like to follow me on my journey, I'll be sharing everything on <a href='https://twitter.com/mcarterj' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Twitter</a>. I also have a RSS feed on this site if you're cool like that. There'll be more tweets than blog posts, but I aim to keep it valuable and non-grifty on both fronts.
