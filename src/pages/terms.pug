      h3 Project Timelines
      p I shall set out milestones for the agreed work with appropriate delivery dates for each. I will keep the Client appraised of progress, and if there are any delays due to technical obstacles and/or resourcing issues. Where delays to a project are caused by the Client, I have the right to adjust delivery dates for subsequent milestone deliverables.

      h3 Testing
      p Prior to delivery of work, I will test it properly and ensure it meets the criteria set out for the work. In the case of websites, this will include testing both functionality and layout across the supported web browsers agreed prior the project commencing.

      h3 Web Browser Support
      p Where agreed work covers the build of actual web pages, these will work in all modern browsers, specifically all browsers with over one percent of the global market share (http://caniuse.com/usage-table). Additional compatibility with older browsers outside of my standard support will need to be agreed as part of the scope of the work.

      h3 Additional or Unscoped Work
      p Should the Client require additional work which is outside the remit of any previously agreed work, I will consider and discuss the requirements with the Client before proposing a solution and any cost associated with this. This additional work will not be undertaken without full agreement from the Client.

      h2 Payments

      h3 Invoicing
      p All invoices should be paid within 15 days of the issue date. Before the commencement of any work, I will agree a payment schedule with the Client . Unless otherwise agreed, an initial invoice is always raised against work, and this must be paid before any work commences.

      h3 Project Milestones and Payments
      p I shall set out milestones for the agreed work and attach invoicing points to relevant milestones. The Client should check and agree to these before the work commences.
      p I will ask for agreement that a milestone has been completed; usually by email. This acts as acceptance and sign-off on the work completed to that point.
      p Any desired amendments to work carried out after an agreed and completed milestone could result in additional costs to the Client. I will always raise and discuss such occurrences and any cost associated will be agreed with the Client before work continues.

      h3 Refunds
      p All payments are final and non-refundable, except in my sole discretion.

      h3 Late Payment
      p If payment on an invoice has not been received 15 after the issue date of an invoice, I have the right to suspend work for that client until payment has been received.
